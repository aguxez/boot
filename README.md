# boot
Discord bot to display stats from a specific match on League of Legends


The bot use is fairly simple, just put it on your server; use `find` + the player that you're looking for and the bot will then display information about the players on the match:

Name, rank and champion being played... This only works for Latin America North as for the day of this upload.

You need a Discord API Key, discord.py and an Api key from the Riot Games API for this to work

Already has the basic dependencies files needed to run on Heroku.
